"""
Our objective is to do the following with the csv data that we have:
- Display:
 1. Show the land temperature of Canada and USA from 1990-2013.
 2. Show the land temperature of United States, Canada and rest of the world form 1990-2013.
 3. Show avg land temperature of various countries from 1990-2013.
 4. Show the land temperature between Most Developed and Least Developed country from 1990-2013.
 5. Show the land temperature between those countries whose land temperature exceeds the global average land
    temperature form 1990-2013.

- Various computations performed within helper functions :
 1. Prepare the data format for all countries with the help of appropriate functions.
 2. Convert the data into relevant data types if needed.
 3. Ignore those data entries whose values are empty.
 4. Extraction of data from a specific period of 1990-2013.

    has a much higher land temperature as compared to Canada. One of the main reasons for this is the levels of
    various greenhouse gases in those countries. The emissions of greenhouse gases like Carbon Dioxide, Nitrous Oxide, 
    etc are much higher in United States as compared to Canada. Rising levels of greenhouse gases contribute greatly 
    to greenhouse effect which is positively correlated to rising land temperatures. Thus we can observe from our graph
