"""
Our objective is to do the following with the csv data that we have:

- Display:
 1. Show the land temperature of Canada and USA from 1990-2013.
 2. Show the land temperature of United States, Canada and rest of the world form 1990-2013.
 3. Show avg land temperature of various countries from 1990-2013.
 4. Show the land temperature between Most Developed and Least Developed country from 1990-2013.
 5. Show the land temperature between those countries whose land temperature exceeds the global
    average land temperature form 1990-2013.

- Various computations performed within helper functions :
 1. Prepare the data format for all countries with the help of appropriate functions.
 2. Convert the data into relevant data types if needed.
 3. Ignore those data entries whose values are empty.
 4. Extraction of data from a specific period of 1990-2013.
